My name is Denis. I am from Russia, Ivanovskaya oblast`. I have worked as an educator of chemistry and a scientifi—Å researcher in this field. Currently, I am unemployed one and I want to become a QA engineer.
In the beginning of 2022, I have finished a QA engineer course by Yandex.Practicum. During the course, I have learned basic priciples of manual testing (planing of testing, kinds of testing, test desing rules, frontend - backend interactions, softwares applied in testing of web-clients (for instance, Charles, mobile apps (Android Studio), APIs(Postman), REST API, SQL requests, YML, JSON ).
To dive more deeply in QA testing, I keep searching , reading and learning additional information related to QA. At the moment, I learn GitHub.
